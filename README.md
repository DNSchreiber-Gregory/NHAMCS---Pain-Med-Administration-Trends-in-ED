Trends in Pain Medication Administration in US Emergency Departments

Overview:
This respository was created to house code creation and updates for an academic paper using NHAMCS data to quantify trends in pain medicaion administration in US Emergency Departments.

Data Source:
This study used data between 2007-2018 obtained from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). The NHAMCS is a federally funded survey that is an annual, multi-stage probability sample survey of hospital visits in the United States. It is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. You can access the data and information about this survey at their website: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/notice.htm.

Process:
It is recommended/required that the code available in this repository be run in order.
1) Download all datasets - years 2007 to 2018
2) Build and run the import/preparation templates for each year - this builds the SAS data files from the provided .txt files
3) [1 Run Me] ED Formats Only (update file paths)
4) [2 Run Me] ED Full Dataset (update file paths)
5) [999 Run Me] Final Data Preparation & Analysis - reflects final changes of last iteration (update file paths)
** This will be updated as the analysis continues to reflect the most up to date version of code.

Additional Notes:
It is recommended that anyone using this code thoroughly review the code prior to and during each iterative run. Pay close attention to all log notes. It is also highly recommended that any person running this code should review all available documentation on NHAMCS data to ensure that the most up to date information and notices are integrated into the individual runs.
